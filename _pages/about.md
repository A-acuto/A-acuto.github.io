I am a data scientist and research associate in the group of Signal Processing at the University of Liverpool (UK) and the
Distributed Algorithms CDT.  
I am involved in a series of projects regarding (broadly):
- multi-domain data and sensor fusion (tracking, Bayesian information fusion);
- AI for decision making (e.g. Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimisation, Reinforcement Learning for cybersecurity);
- Natural language processing (NLP);
- Software development;

I am an active contributor to [Stone Soup](https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup) development.

I completed a PhD in Astrophysics and Cosmology at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) in 2022 working on large scale 
structure cosmology with numerical simulations and influence of baryons. I was part of the first cohort of the 
[LiV.DAT](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/livdat/) Centre for doctoral training (CDT) with focus on big data and 
artificial intelligence.
